## Welcome to my corner! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aemmadi/aemmadi/master/wave.gif" width="30">

I'm Keith Rincon, or you can call me Kiki. I'm a self-taught Front-end Web Developer from 🇺🇸 **California, USA**, and 🇲🇽 **Jalisco, Mexico**. I stumbled into coding during a lean launch business class in my final semester of college back in 2013. The project eventually led to helping revamp our family’s restaurant. In 2019, I had the idea of creating a sports-oriented social media platform and decided to build it while learning how to code.

Learning how to code has been the most challenging thing I've ever done, even more challenging than working 13-hour shifts on my feet all day and collaborating with family at the busiest Mexican Restaurant in California, which is called 🇲🇽 **Guadalajara Mexican Restaurant** in Redding. However, I won't ever quit learning because my ultimate goal is to secure a web developer position.
